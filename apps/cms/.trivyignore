# Trivy ignore file
# Use this to suppress specific CVEs that are:
# 1. False positives
# 2. Not applicable to our use case
# 3. Awaiting upstream fixes

# Example format:
# CVE-2024-12345  # Description: Why we're ignoring this
# CVE-2024-67890  # Will fix in next release after upstream patch

# Note: Review this file regularly and remove entries once vulnerabilities are patched
# Currently no ignored CVEs - all vulnerabilities should be addressed
